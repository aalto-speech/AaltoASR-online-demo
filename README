To build online-demo, checkout decoder, aku, lapackpp, and paragui projects from
CVS, into the same directory where you have online-demo project.

In Debian based systems, you need to install the following packages:
liblapack-dev
libblas-dev
libfftw3-dev
libsndfile1-dev
libsigc++-1.2-dev
portaudio19-dev
swig
autoconf
libtool
libsdl-dev
libexpat-dev
libphysfs-dev
g++

paragui and lapackpp use the GNU Autotools build system.

For lapackpp, call:

./configure --enable-static=yes --enable-shared=no
make

For paragui:

./configure --enable-internalphysfs --enable-static=yes --enable-shared=no
make

Don't call make install. Then call make in all the other project directories.
