To build online-demo, checkout decoder, aku, lapackpp, and paragui-online-demo projects from
CVS, into the same directory where you have online-demo project.

In Debian based systems, you need to install the following packages:
liblapack-dev
libblas-dev
libfftw3-dev
libsndfile1-dev
libsigc++-1.2-dev
portaudio19-dev
swig
autoconf
libtool
libsdl-dev
libexpat-dev
libphysfs-dev
g++
fort77

paragui-online-demo and lapackpp use the GNU Autotools build system.

For lapackpp, call:

./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-static=yes --enable-shared=no
make

For paragui-online-demo:

./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-internalphysfs --enable-static=yes --enable-shared=no
make

Don't call make install. Then call make in all the other project directories.
