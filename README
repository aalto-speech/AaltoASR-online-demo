To build online-demo, checkout aku, lapackpp, and paragui projects from CVS,
into the same directory where you have online-demo project.

In Debian based systems, you need to install the following dependencies:
liblapack-dev
libblas-dev
libfftw3-dev
libsndfile1-dev
libsigc++-1.2-dev
portaudio19-dev

In Red Hat based systems, you need to install the following dependencies:
lapack-devel
blas-devel
fftw-devel
libsndfile-devel
libsigc++-devel
portaudio-devel

paragui and lapackpp use the GNU Autotools build system, so you have to call

./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-static=yes --enable-shared=no
make

in both project directories. Don't call make install. Then call make in all the
other project directories.

Not sure if swig is required as well.
